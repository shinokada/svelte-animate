# Svelte-Animate

The svelte-animate library provides a collection of animated, customizable, and accessible UI components for Svelte projects. It includes two main types of components:

## Animation Wrapper Component (Animate.svelte)

This component is a flexible wrapper that can animate any child element using animate.css animations, with support for multiple triggers like hover and click. Users can customize the animation type, duration, and visibility control, allowing the child elements to be shown temporarily or hidden after the animation completes.

## Interactive Icon Components

The library includes a series of animated SVG icons, such as AcademicCap.svelte, designed for seamless integration and user interaction. Each icon can be animated using Svelteâ€™s draw transition, with configurable trigger events (mouseenter or click), animation duration, and delay. Users can adjust properties like size, color, stroke width, and add accessible labels or descriptions for screen readers.

## Key Features

- Customizable Animations: Control animation types, duration, and timing for both wrapper and icon components.
- Interactive Events: Choose animation triggers, enabling icons and elements to respond to user actions.
- Accessible and Flexible Design: Every component supports ARIA labeling, size adjustments, and color customization, making it easy to match any UI and support users with assistive technologies.
- Ease of Use: Simply add any icon or wrapper to your project and adjust props to fit your design needs.

The svelte-animate library is ideal for developers looking to add dynamic, accessible animations and icons to Svelte applications, enhancing the user experience with minimal setup.
